So, I shelved my idea inside a deep cupboard in my mind. But, all of a sudden.. Google Photography Prize Contest was announced! I contemplated hard on what theme to decide on, and finally figured this is the right moment to bring out my idea of capturing the Indian Streets and all the emotions it conveys to me everyday!!</p><p>So, here is the beginning of my series on Emotions in Street Photography which was my entry into the competition. Each photo is accompanied by what I felt when I was clicking that photo.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Dreams</strong></span></p><p>This was the first time I had a camera in my hand with sole purpose of taking pictures on streets. There&#8217;s this dream that I wanted and hoped to make real for so long.. Just when I was thinking all this in my mind, I saw a man who sells baskets for a living go past me. His gaze was not forward, but down on the road. Soon, a Tata Indica(?) zoomed past us (well, 60 kmph is considered very fast on that road <img src="http://sillyreflections.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> ), and this man lifted his head.. looking at the car and I felt as if he was dreaming to buy such a car someday!!</p><div id="attachment_386" style="width: 612px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://sillyreflections.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/dream-to-buy-such-a-car-some-day.jpg" rel="lightbox[378]" title="Dream- To buy such a car some day"><img class="wp-image-386" title="Dream- To buy such a car some day" src="http://sillyreflections.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/dream-to-buy-such-a-car-some-day.jpg" alt="Dream- To buy such a car some day" width="602" height="400" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Dream- To buy such a car some day</p></div> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>http://sillyreflections.com/2012/02/17/dreams/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>13</slash:comments> </item> </channel> </rss>
