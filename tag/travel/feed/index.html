So a very big Thank You! It&#8217;s been two years since I started blogging and was encouraged all the time by you to keep going. It all started as a<a title="New Year Resolutions 2012" href="https://sillyreflections.com/2011/12/23/new-year-resolutions-2012/"> New Year resolution for 2012</a>, now it feels like this has been the best implemented resolution in my life!</p><p>As I got the Happy Anniversary notification from WordPress, I became enthused to see how far we had come. Here are some interesting facts I unearthed!</p><p>1. Having had <strong>22477 views from 142 countries</strong> all over the world &#8211; I am absolutely awestruck that my thoughts reached so many people in the world! Truly internet is a very powerful medium.</p><div id="attachment_1619" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://sillyreflections.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Mp.png" rel="lightbox[1607]" title="It's Been Two Years"><img class="size-large wp-image-1619" alt="Visitors Map" src="https://sillyreflections.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Mp-660x454.png" width="600" height="412" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Visitors Map</p></div><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">2. Around <strong>80% of people</strong> who visit my website are new and are usually here due to organic search results.</span></p><div id="attachment_1620" style="width: 412px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://sillyreflections.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/visitor.png" rel="lightbox[1607]" title="It's Been Two Years"><img class="size-full wp-image-1620" alt="New visitors" src="https://sillyreflections.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/visitor.png" width="402" height="391" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Visitors type</p></div><p>3. <strong>75% of the visits last for less than 10 seconds</strong>! I wonder what do they even see in such short time! But we can also see that many page views also result from 3-30 minutes visits which I think shows that they are interested in going through other posts too.</p><div id="attachment_1618" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://sillyreflections.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/time.png" rel="lightbox[1607]" title="It's Been Two Years"><img class="size-large wp-image-1618" alt="Time spent" src="https://sillyreflections.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/time-660x144.png" width="600" height="130" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Time spent by visitors</p></div><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">And now to the fun part for today. To celebrate this occasion, I have decided to give few awards to posts on this website!<br /> <strong>People&#8217;s Choice Award:</strong> The post with most number of views is <a title="Most Popular Birding Apps for Android" href="https://sillyreflections.com/2012/05/16/most-popular-birding-apps-for-android/">Most Popular Android Apps for Birding</a>. I always believed that cross-domain knowledge leads to a unique perspective which can be beneficial for many people. My two favorite things which gave this post &#8211; birding and Android, drive home this point!<br /> </span></p><p><strong>Editor&#8217;s Choice Award:</strong> The award goes to <a title="Birds of IIT Guwahati" href="https://sillyreflections.com/2012/02/08/birds-of-iit-guwahati/">Birds of IIT Guwahati</a>! This post misses the above award with difference of just a few views, but wins the Editor&#8217;s choice as the post that was driving force of this website in the beginning days!</p><p><strong>Most Popular Bird: </strong>Surprisingly the most popular bird on this website has been <a title="Common Tailorbird" href="https://sillyreflections.com/2012/04/13/common-tailorbird/">Common Tailorbird</a>. What do you think is the reason for this!?</p><p><strong>Most viewed Photo</strong> (birds not included)<strong>:</strong> My personal favorite <a title="Lonely" href="https://sillyreflections.com/2012/02/20/lonely/">Lonely</a> wins this last award.</p><p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">It amazes me how much I myself and my writings have changed over the time unknowingly and was pleasantly surprised reading my own past posts!</span></p><p>I have noted the readers feedback received in terms of keywords searched, views and engaging posts etc  and decided to write more on those topics. This year, you will see me write a lot on travel, Android as well as birding. So, stay tuned!</p><p>And one last thing, do let me know what you think in the below comments section!</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>https://sillyreflections.com/2013/12/19/its-been-two-years/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>2</slash:comments> </item> <item><title>Long Time, No See</title><link>https://sillyreflections.com/2013/12/15/long-time-no-see/</link> <comments>https://sillyreflections.com/2013/12/15/long-time-no-see/#comments</comments> <pubDate>Sun, 15 Dec 2013 14:56:21 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Avinash Hindupur]]></dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[Life]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Chennai]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Travel]]></category> <category><![CDATA[US]]></category><guid isPermaLink="false">https://sillyreflections.com/?p=1582</guid> <description><![CDATA[Wow, it&#8217;s been really long time since I blogged and a lot of things happened during this time.
