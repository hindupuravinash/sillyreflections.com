Perhaps next time, I will come up with some points and describe how it feels when I&#8217;m out there so that you can decide if you wanna begin bird watching!</p><p>Here is a picture taken right in the middle of a metro city &#8211; Chennai! It is a very popular birding place called Pallikkaranai Marsh, often said to be &#8220;Green Lungs of the City&#8221;, it faces the same threats as other wetlands all over the world &#8211; human encroachment, drying up, pollution. But when I stand there watching the birds, I forget the surroundings, the blaring horns, the road-side dust or burning sun, I just keep watching!!</p><div id="attachment_1639" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://sillyreflections.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Pallikaranai-Marsh-Birding.jpg" rel="lightbox[1638]" title="Why Birding?"><img class="size-full wp-image-1639" src="https://sillyreflections.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Pallikaranai-Marsh-Birding.jpg" alt="Why Birding? - At peace in  Pallikkaranai Marsh" width="600" height="400" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Why Birding? &#8211; At peace in Pallikkaranai Marsh</p></div><p>&nbsp;</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>https://sillyreflections.com/2014/05/02/why-birding/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>2</slash:comments> </item> <item><title>A Productivity Hack I Learnt Recently</title><link>https://sillyreflections.com/2014/04/27/a-productivity-hack-i-learnt-recently/</link> <comments>https://sillyreflections.com/2014/04/27/a-productivity-hack-i-learnt-recently/#comments</comments> <pubDate>Sat, 26 Apr 2014 23:50:13 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Avinash Hindupur]]></dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[Life]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Hack]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Productivity]]></category><guid isPermaLink="false">https://sillyreflections.com/?p=1643</guid> <description><![CDATA[We all learn a lot of lessons in our daily life which make us more productive or efficient than we were.

I had one such experience which changed the way I approach tasks and hope you will benefit from it as well.</p><p>Whenever I had some task on my plate, be it writing the next blog post or deciding on the next weekend getaway or personal project, I used to think or google a lot on it. I know that doing prior research is good, but doing too much can be bad too.</p><p>Recently, I realized three things about this approach:</p><p>1. I spent too much time getting all the info about the task at hand, so much that it no longer interested me.</p><p>2. I amassed a lot of information which made it difficult to decide what to do or where to begin with especially if I were a beginner in that.</p><p>3. Even though all this information consumption felt good, it means nothing until I finish my goal.</p><p>So, to overcome these factors, I came up with some hacks that have worked for me.</p><p>Now before beginning any such tasks, I do the following:</p><p>1.  Set deadlines for myself and make sure to abide by them, this helps me plan the whole task in a lot better way.</p><p>2. Instead of thinking a lot on how to begin the tasks, wherever possible, I ask people who are already experienced to guide me.</p><p>3. If the above is not possible, I learn enough info just to begin and see it works out.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Did you face similar issues too? How did you overcome them? You can share your tips and tricks with me below.</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>https://sillyreflections.com/2014/04/27/a-productivity-hack-i-learnt-recently/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>4</slash:comments> </item> <item><title>East Coast Sunrise</title><link>https://sillyreflections.com/2014/04/24/east-coast-sunrise/</link> <comments>https://sillyreflections.com/2014/04/24/east-coast-sunrise/#comments</comments> <pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2014 16:20:53 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Avinash Hindupur]]></dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[Life]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Photography]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Chennai]]></category> <category><![CDATA[India]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Ocean]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Sunrise]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Weekend]]></category><guid isPermaLink="false">https://sillyreflections.com/?p=1635</guid> <description><![CDATA[One of the best things one gets to enjoy in east coasts all over the world are the sunrises!

A major plot in the Trilogy involved a mighty river right in the middle of a desert around which the ideal civilization flourished, whose drying would threaten the very existence of the nation.</p><p>The possibility of such a scenario and the familiarity of all the places in the story made me do a quick fact search. It was really surprising when I found that  Thar Desert indeed had a great river flowing through it and the civilization was similar to the Harappa Civilization!</p><p>Now that I was on trail of this river, I wanted to know more about the river and chanced  upon The Lost River &#8211; On the trail of the Sarasvati. The book is a wonderful read and explores the various scenarios surrounding the life of the river. Imagine a river which impacted the life of thousands living in cities around 3000-1000 BC, the picture that comes to mind fascinates me! Michel Danino also tries to answer some of the questions that arise regarding the continuity of the culture, the Aryan Invasion as well as the fate of the river as such.</p><p>If you are a history buff who would be interested to know more about one of the greatest puzzles of civilizations or you are just a bored panda sitting on a couch waiting to get inspired or awed by ancient life, I would recommend this book to you! In the mean time, I just wish to for an awesome Hollywood movie to be made on this subject!!</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>https://sillyreflections.com/2014/04/19/the-lost-river-on-the-trail-of-the-sarasvati/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> <item><title>It&#8217;s Been Two Years</title><link>https://sillyreflections.com/2013/12/19/its-been-two-years/</link> <comments>https://sillyreflections.com/2013/12/19/its-been-two-years/#comments</comments> <pubDate>Wed, 18 Dec 2013 21:12:22 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Avinash Hindupur]]></dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[Life]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Android]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Birding]]></category> <category><![CDATA[New Year]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Resolutions]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Travel]]></category><guid isPermaLink="false">https://sillyreflections.com/?p=1607</guid> <description><![CDATA[This week, I have a big thing to cheer about and I should really thank you all for this.

So a very big Thank You! It&#8217;s been two years since I started blogging and was encouraged all the time by you to keep going. It all started as a<a title="New Year Resolutions 2012" href="https://sillyreflections.com/2011/12/23/new-year-resolutions-2012/"> New Year resolution for 2012</a>, now it feels like this has been the best implemented resolution in my life!</p><p>As I got the Happy Anniversary notification from WordPress, I became enthused to see how far we had come. Here are some interesting facts I unearthed!</p><p>1. Having had <strong>22477 views from 142 countries</strong> all over the world &#8211; I am absolutely awestruck that my thoughts reached so many people in the world! Truly internet is a very powerful medium.</p><div id="attachment_1619" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://sillyreflections.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Mp.png" rel="lightbox[1607]" title="It's Been Two Years"><img class="size-large wp-image-1619" alt="Visitors Map" src="https://sillyreflections.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Mp-660x454.png" width="600" height="412" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Visitors Map</p></div><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">2. Around <strong>80% of people</strong> who visit my website are new and are usually here due to organic search results.</span></p><div id="attachment_1620" style="width: 412px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://sillyreflections.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/visitor.png" rel="lightbox[1607]" title="It's Been Two Years"><img class="size-full wp-image-1620" alt="New visitors" src="https://sillyreflections.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/visitor.png" width="402" height="391" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Visitors type</p></div><p>3. <strong>75% of the visits last for less than 10 seconds</strong>! I wonder what do they even see in such short time! But we can also see that many page views also result from 3-30 minutes visits which I think shows that they are interested in going through other posts too.</p><div id="attachment_1618" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://sillyreflections.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/time.png" rel="lightbox[1607]" title="It's Been Two Years"><img class="size-large wp-image-1618" alt="Time spent" src="https://sillyreflections.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/time-660x144.png" width="600" height="130" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Time spent by visitors</p></div><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">And now to the fun part for today. To celebrate this occasion, I have decided to give few awards to posts on this website!<br /> <strong>People&#8217;s Choice Award:</strong> The post with most number of views is <a title="Most Popular Birding Apps for Android" href="https://sillyreflections.com/2012/05/16/most-popular-birding-apps-for-android/">Most Popular Android Apps for Birding</a>. I always believed that cross-domain knowledge leads to a unique perspective which can be beneficial for many people. My two favorite things which gave this post &#8211; birding and Android, drive home this point!<br /> </span></p><p><strong>Editor&#8217;s Choice Award:</strong> The award goes to <a title="Birds of IIT Guwahati" href="https://sillyreflections.com/2012/02/08/birds-of-iit-guwahati/">Birds of IIT Guwahati</a>! This post misses the above award with difference of just a few views, but wins the Editor&#8217;s choice as the post that was driving force of this website in the beginning days!</p><p><strong>Most Popular Bird: </strong>Surprisingly the most popular bird on this website has been <a title="Common Tailorbird" href="https://sillyreflections.com/2012/04/13/common-tailorbird/">Common Tailorbird</a>. What do you think is the reason for this!?</p><p><strong>Most viewed Photo</strong> (birds not included)<strong>:</strong> My personal favorite <a title="Lonely" href="https://sillyreflections.com/2012/02/20/lonely/">Lonely</a> wins this last award.</p><p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">It amazes me how much I myself and my writings have changed over the time unknowingly and was pleasantly surprised reading my own past posts!</span></p><p>I have noted the readers feedback received in terms of keywords searched, views and engaging posts etc  and decided to write more on those topics. This year, you will see me write a lot on travel, Android as well as birding. So, stay tuned!</p><p>And one last thing, do let me know what you think in the below comments section!</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>https://sillyreflections.com/2013/12/19/its-been-two-years/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>2</slash:comments> </item> <item><title>Long Time, No See</title><link>https://sillyreflections.com/2013/12/15/long-time-no-see/</link> <comments>https://sillyreflections.com/2013/12/15/long-time-no-see/#comments</comments> <pubDate>Sun, 15 Dec 2013 14:56:21 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Avinash Hindupur]]></dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[Life]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Chennai]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Travel]]></category> <category><![CDATA[US]]></category><guid isPermaLink="false">https://sillyreflections.com/?p=1582</guid> <description><![CDATA[Wow, it&#8217;s been really long time since I blogged and a lot of things happened during this time.

Each cell is a factory that produces and exports molecules. For instance, insulin is manufactured and released into the blood and chemical signals called neurotransmitters are sent from one nerve cell to another. These molecules are transported around the cell in small packages called vesicles. The three Nobel Laureates have discovered the molecular principles that govern how this cargo is delivered to the right place at the right time in the cell.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Randy Schekman discovered a set of genes that were required for vesicle traffic. James Rothman unravelled protein machinery that allows vesicles to fuse with their targets to permit transfer of cargo. Thomas Südhof revealed how signals instruct vesicles to release their cargo with precision.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Through their discoveries, Rothman, Schekman and Südhof have revealed the exquisitely precise control system for the transport and delivery of cellular cargo. Disturbances in this system have deleterious effects and contribute to conditions such as neurological diseases, diabetes, and immunological disorders.&#8221;</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>https://sillyreflections.com/2013/10/07/nobel-prize-winners-in-physiology-or-medicine-2013/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> <item><title>Checklist of ICRISAT</title><link>https://sillyreflections.com/2013/09/04/checklist-of-icrisat/</link> <comments>https://sillyreflections.com/2013/09/04/checklist-of-icrisat/#comments</comments> <pubDate>Tue, 03 Sep 2013 23:31:46 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator><![CDATA[Avinash Hindupur]]></dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[Birds]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Nature]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Urban Birding]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Wildlife]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Birding]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Hyderabad]]></category> <category><![CDATA[India]]></category><guid isPermaLink="false">https://sillyreflections.com/?p=983</guid> <description><![CDATA[A common checklist compiled from various sources on the web which give information regarding birding at ICRISAT!
