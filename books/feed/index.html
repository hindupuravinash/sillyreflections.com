A major plot in the Trilogy involved a mighty river right in the middle of a desert around which the ideal civilization flourished, whose drying would threaten the very existence of the nation.</p><p>The possibility of such a scenario and the familiarity of all the places in the story made me do a quick fact search. It was really surprising when I found that  Thar Desert indeed had a great river flowing through it and the civilization was similar to the Harappa Civilization!</p><p>Now that I was on trail of this river, I wanted to know more about the river and chanced  upon The Lost River &#8211; On the trail of the Sarasvati. The book is a wonderful read and explores the various scenarios surrounding the life of the river. Imagine a river which impacted the life of thousands living in cities around 3000-1000 BC, the picture that comes to mind fascinates me! Michel Danino also tries to answer some of the questions that arise regarding the continuity of the culture, the Aryan Invasion as well as the fate of the river as such.</p><p>If you are a history buff who would be interested to know more about one of the greatest puzzles of civilizations or you are just a bored panda sitting on a couch waiting to get inspired or awed by ancient life, I would recommend this book to you! In the mean time, I just wish to for an awesome Hollywood movie to be made on this subject!!</p> ]]></content:encoded> <wfw:commentRss>https://sillyreflections.com/2014/04/19/the-lost-river-on-the-trail-of-the-sarasvati/feed/</wfw:commentRss> <slash:comments>0</slash:comments> </item> </channel> </rss>
